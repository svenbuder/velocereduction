@article{Jofre2019,
	abstract = {{There has been an incredibly large investment in obtaining high-
        resolution stellar spectra for determining chemical abundances
        of stars. This information is crucial to answer fundamental
        questions in astronomy by constraining the formation and
        evolution scenarios of the Milky Way as well as the stars and
        planets residing in it. We have just entered a new era, in which
        chemical abundances of FGK-type stars are being produced at
        industrial scales, and in which the observations, reduction, and
        analysis of the data are automatically performed by machines.
        Here, we review the latest human efforts to assess the accuracy
        and precision of such industrial abundances by providing
        insights into the steps and uncertainties associated with the
        process of determining stellar abundances. We also provide a
        description of current and forthcoming spectroscopic surveys,
        focusing on their reported abundances and uncertainties. This
        allows us to identify which elements and spectral lines are best
        and why. Finally, we make a brief selection of main scientific
        questions the community is aiming to answer with abundances.
        Uncertainties in abundances need to be disentangled into random
        and systematic components. Precision can be increased by
        applying differential or data-driven methods based on accurate
        data. High-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra provide
        fundamental data that can be used to calibrate lower-resolution
        and signal-to-noise spectra of millions of stars. Different
        survey calibration strategies must agree on a common set of
        reference stars to create data products that are consistent.
        Data products provided by individual groups must be published
        using standard formats to ensure straightforward applicability.
